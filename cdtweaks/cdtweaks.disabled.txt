The settings in this file allow for this mod to be installed in an unattended mode, e.g.
if you install Tweaks Anthology with the Big World Setup. A handful of components will
otherwise pause WeiDU and wait for input; defining these values ahead of time in this 
file will instead use the values defined here instead of waiting on user input in the
middle of installation.

To use this file, rename it as cdtweaks.txt and leave it in the cdtweaks folder.

// e.g. 50 will reduce the time between romance talks to half (50%) of the current
