The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process, that is more art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@109014 = ~Katana +2, Tsu-O-Shi
Tsu-O-Shi, also known as the Coveted Blade, was forged in the nation of Wa more than five centuries ago, by the sword smith Murakaken Shinji, whose skill was so great he was rumored to be able to awaken the very spirit of the metal. Tsu-O-Shi passed through the hands of the various heirs of the otherwise unremarkable Kasune family, until the powerful daimyo and well-known sword lover Fushima Takagi saw it. Takagi became obsessed with the sword and made many frustrated attempts to acquire the blade. Finally, he hired a clan of ninja to steal the blade for him, covering its loss with the burning of the Kasune family compound. When the ninja presented the blade to their employer, it was used to cut them down, forever removing any link between Takagi and the sword's legitimate owners. Takagi hid the sword, often withdrawing to its hiding place to gaze upon its beauty and perfection. On the day Takagi died, his spirit refused to depart the earth and leave the sword behind, so he stayed with Tsu-O-Shi, becoming one with it. From that day forth, any who wield the mighty Tsu-O-Shi must beware of the spirit of Fushima Takagi, who drinks the life essence of those who touch the weapon, in order to remain on Toril with the object of his desire. As a result, this cursed blade has a chance to drain the wielder every time it is used.
